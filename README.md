# Support Vector Machine (SVM) from Scratch  

This project implements **Support Vector Machine (SVM) from scratch** using **NumPy**.  
It is trained using **batch gradient descent** with hinge loss optimization and supports **decision boundary visualization**.

## Features  
âœ… Implements both **Hard Margin and Soft Margin SVM**  
âœ… Uses **Hinge Loss** for optimization  
âœ… Mini-batch **Gradient Descent** implementation  
âœ… **Supports vector identification**  
âœ… **Decision boundary visualization** with margins  

## Installation  
### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries:  

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Aman-raj25/svm-from-scratch.git
cd svm-from-scratch
Run the program:
bash
Copy
Edit
python svm_from_scratch.py
Expected Output
The console will display loss values at each epoch.
A real-time decision boundary plot will be generated, showing support vectors and margins.
File Structure
