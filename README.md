Support Vector Machine (SVM) from Scratch
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) from scratch using NumPy.
It is trained using mini-batch gradient descent with hinge loss optimization and supports decision boundary visualization.

📌 Features
✅ Implements both Hard Margin and Soft Margin SVM
✅ Uses Hinge Loss for optimization
✅ Mini-batch Gradient Descent implementation
✅ Supports vector identification
✅ Decision boundary visualization with margins

📦 Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
🚀 Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Aman-raj25/svm-from-scratch.git
cd svm-from-scratch
Run the program:
bash
Copy
Edit
python svm_from_scratch.py
📊 Expected Output
The console will display Data Distribution.
A decision boundary plot will be generated, showing support vectors and margins.
📂 File Structure
